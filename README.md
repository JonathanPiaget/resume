# My Resume

This repository contains my personal resume, built using a template created by [MiraHikari](https://github.com/MiraHikari/portfolio). I have adapted the original design to fit my needs and preferences, focusing primarily on **internationalization (i18n)** improvements and any necessary layout and content tweaks.
